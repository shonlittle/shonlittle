# ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey, I'm Shon Little

Youâ€™ve stumbled upon my GitHub profile â€” either youâ€™re here to poach me for your next big tech adventure (excellent choice), or you got lost looking for a leprechaun. Either way, welcome!

## About Me (the abridged version)

I'm a **Software Engineering Leader**, **AI solution wrangler**, and occasional **bug whisperer**, with 20+ years of experience building digital things that actually *work*. Iâ€™ve led global teams, architected scalable systems, and once deployed to prod on a Friday. It went fine. Nobody believes me.

In short:  
I build stuff. I ship it. I teach others to do the same. And I drink a lot of coffee in the process.

## My Toolkit (aka toys I know how to use)

```bash
Languages:      Python, JS/TS, C#, Java, SQL (and the tears of legacy VB)
Frameworks:     FastAPI, React, Django, Flask, .NET, Spring Boot
Clouds:         AWS, GCP, Azure â€” Iâ€™m cloud-agnostic and drama-free
Tools:          Docker, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Alteryx
Buzzwords:      AI/ML, REST, GraphQL, OAuth, MVP, ROI, LOL
```
## Current Focus

I'm exploring new opportunities to lead software innovation at the intersection of **AI**, **cloud-native engineering**, and **human-centered design**. Iâ€™m passionate about mentoring teams, scaling impactful products, and building systems that balance elegance and performance.

## Fun Facts

- Built a real-time meat defect tracker (yes, meat) that saved millions.
- Designed a flight disruption optimizer now used across the airline industry.
- Mentored engineers who now mentor other engineers â€” recursion at its best.
- Still writes clean code and occasionally forgets semicolons on purpose.
- Modeled microservices architecture using LEGO at an offsite. It worked.

## Currently Seeking

The next great opportunity where I can:
- Lead brilliant humans
- Build elegant software
- Solve hairy problems (bonus points if they're in regulated industries or on fire)

If youâ€™re building something exciting (or slightly chaotic), letâ€™s talk.
