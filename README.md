# 👋 Oh hey, I'm Shon Little

You’ve stumbled upon my GitHub profile — either you’re here to poach me for your next big tech adventure (excellent choice), or you got lost looking for a leprechaun. Either way, welcome!

## About Me (the abridged version)

I'm a **Software Engineering Leader**, **AI solution wrangler**, and occasional **bug whisperer**, with 20+ years of experience building digital things that actually _work_. I’ve led global teams, architected scalable systems, and once deployed to prod on a Friday. It went fine. Nobody believes me.

In short:  
I build stuff; I ship it; I teach others to do the same. And I drink a lot of coffee in the process.

## My Toolkit (aka toys I know how to use)

```text
Languages:      JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL, Java, Go, C#, PHP, VB, HTML, CSS, (and the tears of legacy VBA)
Frontend:       React.js, Angular, D3.js, Redux, Material UI, Bootstrap, LESS, Sass, Material Design, and jQuery...because I’ve been coding since dinosaurs roamed the DOM.
Backend:        Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, Express, Spring Boot, ASP.NET
Databases:      PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Neo4j, Redshift, Redis, and a hint of Microsoft Access nostalgia.
Cloud:          AWS, GCP, and Azure — I’m cloud-agnostic.
DevOps:         Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.
API:            REST and GraphQL.
Security:       OAuth 2.0 and JWT.
Data & BI:      Alteryx, Business Intelligence, Performance Metrics, Data Analytics and Database Management.
AI:             LangChain, Pinecone, LLMs, and RAGs — all wrapped in a candy-coded shell.
Buzzwords:      MVP, ROI, LOL
```

## Current Focus

I'm exploring new opportunities to lead software innovation at the intersection of **AI**, **cloud-native engineering**, and **human-centered design**. I’m passionate about mentoring teams, scaling impactful products, and building systems that balance elegance and performance.

## Fun Facts

- Built a real-time meat defect tracker (yes, meat) that saved millions.
- Designed the interface for a flight disruption optimizer now used across the airline industry.
- Mentored engineers who now mentor other engineers — recursion at its best.
- Still writing clean code and occasionally forgetting semicolons...on purpose.
- I'm a certified Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) and Professional Scrum Master (PSM) and sometimes argue with myself about the backlog.
- Once received an award for innovation in software engineering...which I assume was a clerical error, but I’ve kept the plaque anyway.

## Currently Seeking

The next great opportunity where I can:

- Lead brilliant humans
- Build elegant software
- Solve hairy problems (bonus points if they're in regulated industries or on fire)

If you’re building something exciting (or especially if it’s slightly chaotic), let’s talk.
