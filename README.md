You've stumbled upon my GitHub profile — either you're here to poach me for your next big tech adventure (excellent choice), or you got lost looking for a leprechaun. Either way, welcome!

## 🚀 About Me (the abridged version)

I'm a **Software Engineering Leader**, **AI solution wrangler**, and occasional **bug whisperer**, with 20+ years of experience building digital things that actually _work_. I've led global teams, architected scalable systems, and once deployed to prod on a Friday. It went fine. Nobody believes me.

In short:  
I build stuff; I ship it; I teach others to do the same. And I drink a lot of coffee in the process.

## 🔨 Current and Active Development Projects

- 🎭 Ongoing maintenance of the [Relevé Studios website](https://relevestudios.com/)
- 📅 Developing **Studio Schedule**, an intelligent scheduling system for dance studios ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/shonlittle/studio-schedule))
- 🌼 Redesigning and upgrading the UI/UX of the [Little Daisy Fund website](http://littledaisy.org/)
- 🤖 Serving as the Dance Studio Owners Association's AI Expert Coach, teaching studio owners and staff the latest AI trends

## 🎯 Current Focus

I'm exploring new opportunities to lead software innovation at the intersection of **AI**, **cloud-native engineering**, and **human-centered design**. I'm passionate about mentoring teams, scaling impactful products, and building systems that balance elegance and performance.

## 🎉 Fun Facts

> **Achievement Unlocked**: Professional Code Whisperer 🏆

- 🥩 Built a real-time meat defect tracker (yes, meat) that saved millions.
- ✈️ Designed the interface for a flight disruption optimizer now used across the airline industry.
- 👨‍🏫 Mentored engineers who now mentor other engineers — recursion at its best.
- 🧹 Still writing clean code and occasionally forgetting semicolons...on purpose.
- 📜 I'm a certified Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) and Professional Scrum Master (PSM) and sometimes argue with myself about the backlog.
- 🏆 Once received an award for innovation in software engineering...which I assume was a clerical error, but I've kept the plaque anyway.

## 🔍 Currently Seeking

<div align="center">

### The next great opportunity where I can:

🧑‍💼 **Lead brilliant humans**  
💻 **Build elegant software**  
🔥 **Solve hairy problems** _(bonus points if they're in regulated industries or on fire)_

If you're building something exciting (or especially if it's slightly chaotic), let's talk.
